    "Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1:Python is a interepreted language and it is very easy to write code in python because of its code simplicity. We can write\n",
    "    code in simple english world. It is knoen as high level language because it converts english code into machine code which is\n",
    "    easily understood by computer i.e 0, and 1. It is general purpose language because it can be use in:\n",
    "        ->web development\n",
    "        ->data domains like data analyst,data scientist,big data etc.\n",
    "        ->android development\n",

    "\n",
    "Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans2: Pyhton is called dynamically typed language because in python variables type is determined at run time i.e at run time \n",
    "      compiler will come to know about the type of variable.\n",

    "Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans3: Pros:\n",
    "        ->Python is extremely beginner-friendly and relatively easy to learn\n",
    "        ->The clear, concise syntax simplifies and speeds up not only learning Python \n",
    "        ->Its standard library grants a lot of pre-built features that allow programmers to work with Internet protocols,\n",
    "           manage operating systems, manipulate data etc..\n",
    "        -> Python leads the pack in deep learning thanks to the vast collection of dedicated libraries\n",
    "     Cons:\n",
    "        ->It can’t boast the same results in speed of execution, lagging behind C ++ and Java.\n",
    "        ->Python programs tend to run out of memory. Developers have to make an extra effort to pinpoint the sources of the \n",
    "          problem and enhance memory management\n",
    "        ->It uses a lot of battery charge, so if you’re coding in Python, you would probably very quickly run down your battery \n",
    "          and quickly run out of memory\n",
